          I work in IAI
         As a quality engineer, my field is in the UAV world.<br>
         I analyze the variety of organization data from several aspects, increases in quality, customer complaints, supplier problems and inspections in the organization.<br>
         Recently I have been working on a dedicated system for tracking and handling the UAV.<br>
         The importance, since we are a government security organization, the quality of the work is a big and main part.<br>
         And if we have a malfunction that repeats several times, what we are doing is probably not right, the customer suffers, the employees work overtime and high non-quality costs.<br>
         In addition, I am studying for a degree in information systems engineering, which contributes to my daily work.<br>
